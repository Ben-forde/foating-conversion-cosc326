# Etude 12: Floating


## Running the program
- To run the program enter: from within the **src** folder run the command

``` 
- You will then be prompted to enter a file to read from. 
- After this enter in a file to write to with the suffix ".bin". 
- The converted floats will then be inside the newly created file.
